# Programmering af immersive teknologier - Assignments

This repository contains individual assignments and projects from the course **"Programmering af immersive teknologier"** (Programming of Immersive Technologies).

## About

This is a collection of Unity scenes developed as part of coursework focusing on immersive technology programming, including VR/AR development and interactive experiences.

## Repository Structure

Each assignment is organized as an individual scene within the Unity project:
-- **Assets/**: Unity project assets including:
  - **Scenes/**: All assignment scenes (HandAnimations.unity, etc.)
- **Packages/**: Unity Package Manager dependencies and project packages
- **ProjectSettings/**: Unity project configuration files (input, build settings, etc.)
- **.gitattributes**: Git LFS configuration for Unity file types
- **.gitignore**: Excludes Unity-generated files from version control
- **README.md**: This documentation file

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Unity 6000.0.57f1 LTS
- Git for version control
- VR headset (Meta Quest, HTC Vive, or compatible device)

### Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in Unity Hub using Unity 6000.0.57f1 LTS
3. Navigate to the **Scenes** folder to access individual assignments
4. Open any assignment scene to test and explore the implementation

### Usage
Each assignment is contained within its own scene file:
- Browse the **Scenes** folder to find specific assignments
- Open individual scenes to see the completed work
- Each scene demonstrates different aspects of immersive technology programming
- Run scenes in Play Mode or deploy to VR hardware to experience the assignments

## Course Information

**Course:** Programmering af immersive teknologier  
**Focus:** Unity development for immersive technologies  
**Technologies:** Unity 6, C#, VR/AR development, XR Interaction Toolkit

## Project Status

ðŸš§ **Active Development** - New assignment scenes will be added throughout the course duration.

### Assignments
#### Hand Animations
The very first assignment where we learned about tracking hands and where you're looking inside the "play" mode on Unity.
As well as some hand animations for, pinching, pointing and making a fist.

## Testing Instructions

1. **Desktop Testing**: Most scenes can be tested in Unity's Play Mode using mouse/keyboard controls
2. **VR Testing**: Connect your VR headset and ensure proper setup before running VR-enabled scenes  
3. **Build Testing**: Some assignments may require building to specific platforms for full functionality

## Notes

- This repository is for educational purposes
- Individual assignment scenes may vary in complexity and scope
- Some scenes require specific VR hardware (headsets, controllers, hand tracking)
- Scenes are designed to be standalone demonstrations of specific concepts
- Shared assets and scripts may be used across multiple assignment scenes

*This repository is maintained as part of coursework and may be updated regularly with new assignment scenes.*
